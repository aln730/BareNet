Goal: Build a mini, bare-metal network stack for `x86`. It will run without an operating system and handle raw Ethernet frames, enabling low-level packet handling and protocal implementation.

To-Do:
- [ ] Bootable x86 kernel using limine
- [ ] Ethernet frame parsing
- [ ] ARP resolution and replies
- [ ] packet routing
- [ ] Ping suppoort


- Language: C, x86 Assembly
- Tools: QEMU, NASM< GRUB
- Architecture: x86(32-bit), Bare Metal


git-gud at low-level networking and systems programming

(kinda works, need to fix limine verions)
