Goal: Build a mini, bare-metal network stack for `x86`. It will run without an operating system and handle raw Ethernet frames, enabling low-level packet handling and protocal implementation.

To-Do:
[] Bootable x86 kernel using GRUB
[] Ethernet frame parsing
[] ARP resolution and replies
[] packet routing
[] Ping suppoort


- Language: C, x86 Assembly
- Tools: QEMU, NASM< GRUB
- Architecture: x86(32-bit), Bare Metal
